Safari960
=========

This Safari extension provides a grid overlay as an aid for implementing grid-based designs. You can toggle it on/off via a toolbar button or the right-click contextual menu and you can customize it per site/hostname. The grid is drawn using HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; and custom site settings are saved using HTML5 localStorage.
